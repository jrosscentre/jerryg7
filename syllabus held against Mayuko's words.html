Software Engineers Reality

The software engineer is often seen as a person who rarely sees the sunlight and has to have glasses from his or her's screen strained eyes. Dressing in hoodies and jeans and sporting a patchy beard, these guys are blobs of excitement aren't they? Well the truth is that software engineers are not this way at all. Drawing from Mayoku's experiences, all types of people are and can be software engineers. She mentions that when she became a software engineer, she would try to fit in to the mold of being "one of the guys" and dressed alike as well. By putting effort into looking and acting a certain way, she took away some of her efforts in collaboration. Now she says her experience is completely different because of the company's efforts to collaborate and get everyone's ideas on different projects so the can be completed quicker and with a better result.

Our syllabus shares many themes with this video. The core values that the software engineer, or whatever computer scientist, is not what the general population imagines. Collaboration is a central theme between the two. The Idea that Collaboration in the computer centered office is a waste of time proves very false. Collaboration allows everyone to share their ideas. People will often come up with different ideas or make certain associations quicker than others, so having multple brains working at the same time can be very helpful. The only problem that can arise is the humanity of the group members and their tenedencies which is why this must be addressed as well. With good relationships between co workers, a collaborative environment can be very beneficial. Thd syllabus discussed the way the class is laid out which is in a partner side by side struggle in projects. this will allow the students to learn how to ccollaborate with lots of different people and in turn learn new persxpectives and strategies. By collaborating with the people around us we can work through things quicker and easier.the chcks and balances that the syllabus lays out to construct our collaboration are all great things that help build strong relationships between peers to help the process move smoothly.
